We organize an international coding sprint from **May 5th 2021** to **May 7th 2021** around [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) and [Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/), two open source tools written in Python and dedicated to neuroimaging.

Nilearn enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes. It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation & friendly community.

Nibabel provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats.

In the [2021 Dev Days](https://nilearn.github.io/dev-days-2021/), we hope to onboard new contributors to our communities and explore future directions for development.
