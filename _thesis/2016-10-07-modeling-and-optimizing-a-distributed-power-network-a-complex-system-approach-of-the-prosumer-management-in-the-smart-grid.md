# Modeling and optimizing a distributed power network : a complex system approach of the prosumer management in the smart grid

## Abstract

This thesis is devoted to the study of agents called prosumers because they can, from renewable, both produce and consume electricity. If their production exceeds their own needs, they are looking to sell their surplus on electricity markets. We propose to model these prosumers from meteorological data, which has allowed us to highlight non trivial spatial and temporal correlations. This is of great importance for aggregators that form portfolios of equipments to sell services to the network
operator. As an aggregator is bound by a contract with the operator, it can be subject to penalties if it does not fulfill its role. We show that these correlations impact the stability of aggregates, and therefore the risk taken by the aggregators. We propose an algorithm minimizing the risk of the aggregations, while maximizing the expected gain. The placement of storage devices in a network where generators and loads are stochastic and not fixed is complex. We propose to answer
this question with control theory. We model the electrical system as a network of coupled oscillators, whose phase angles dynamics is an approximation of the actual dynamics of the system. The goal is to find the subset of nodes in the graph that, during a disturbance of the system, allows returning to equilibrium if the right signals are injected and this with a minimum energy. We propose an algorithm to find a near optimal placement to minimize the average energy control
