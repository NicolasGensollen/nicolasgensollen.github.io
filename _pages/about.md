I am currently a research engineer in the [PARIETAL](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Saclay working on developping and maintaining neuro-science and machine learning softwares. The PARIETAL team is indeed heavily invested in community-driven open source projects such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [NiLearn](http://nilearn.github.io/), [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/dev/index.html), or [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to name a few. I have a strong interest in open source projects, you can find more details on my contributions through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/nicolasgensollen), or in the [Open source section](https://nicolasgensollen.github.io/open_source/) of this website.

### Prior positions

Before joining INRIA, I was a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks](http://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team, at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/) (LIP6) from December 2018 to October 2020. My work at LIP6 was focused on designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions using the framework of [stream graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04073). 

The main applications of this work are related to fraud detection in financial transactions such as credit card or blockchain based transaction records. I also have a strong interest in the study of **social systems relying on the blockchain technology**. These systems range from social networks where users can monetize their content to specific cryptocurrencies in which social ties are used to enhance security. In such environments, there exists complex interplays between pure social interactions and financial transactions. Understanding these interactions requires designing new models and is an active and fascinating field of research.

Before working at LIP6, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the *Power Systems Design and Studies* group at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA from March 2017 to November 2018. The purpose of this group is to study how power distribution systems can sustain the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources. Distribution systems have complex non linear dynamics and ensuring their stability with increasing penetration of renewables is a challenge. Within this group, I was mainly working on creating and implementing optimization methods to solve large scale problems such as distribution planning or hosting capacity analysis. Designing these *smart power grids* is a field of research at the crossroad of power system engineering, computer science, telecommunication, electronics, statistics, economy, sociology, and many more. I particularly enjoyed working in such an interdisciplinary field of research and building collaboration with researchers from different domains and with different backgrounds.

### PhD thesis and resume

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on modeling and optimizing *smart power grid systems*. For more details, you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01454975/document).
