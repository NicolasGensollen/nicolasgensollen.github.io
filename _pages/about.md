About me
======

I am a postdoctoral reasearcher in the *Complex Networks* team, at the computer science laboratory of Paris 6 (LIP6) since December 2018. My work at LIP6 is focused on designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions. This kind of data mixing structure and time is extremely common nowadays and spans several domains like sociology (social interactions between human being like phone calls, SMS, likes, comments, physical proximity...), finance (transactions and payments between accounts),
or networking (packet exchanges between machines, TCP sessions...) to name only a few.
