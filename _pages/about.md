I am currently a [SED](https://sed.paris.inria.fr/service/) research engineer at the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) [Paris center](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-de-paris), in France, working mostly in the [ARAMIS team](https://www.aramislab.fr/) located at the [Paris Brain Institute](https://icm-institute.org/en/mission-en/) (ICM). Part of my work is dedicaed to neuro-science tools like [Clinica](https://www.clinica.run/) or [Leaspy](https://leaspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), developed by the ARAMIS team.

Before joining the Paris center, I was a research engineer in the [PARIETAL](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team at the [Saclay center](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) of [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr). I was mainly working on developping and maintaining neuro-science and machine learning softwares like [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn) in which I am still involved as a core developer.

I have a strong interest in open source projects, you can find more details on my contributions through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/nicolasgensollen), or in the [Open source section](https://nicolasgensollen.github.io/open_source/) of this website.

### Prior positions

Before joining INRIA, I was a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks](http://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team, at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/) (LIP6) from December 2018 to October 2020. My work at LIP6 was focused on designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions using the framework of [stream graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04073). The main applications of this work are related to fraud detection in financial transactions such as credit card or blockchain based transaction records. 

Before working at LIP6, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Power Systems Design and Studies](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/power-systems-design-studies.html) group at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA from March 2017 to November 2018. The purpose of this group is to study how power distribution systems can sustain the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources. Distribution systems have complex non linear dynamics and ensuring their stability with increasing penetration of renewables is a challenge. Within this group, I was mainly working on creating and implementing optimization methods to solve large scale problems such as *distribution planning* or *hosting capacity analysis*. 

### PhD thesis and resume

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on modeling and optimizing *smart power grid systems*. For more details, you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01454975/document).

You can find more details in my [CV](https://nicolasgensollen.github.io/cv/).
