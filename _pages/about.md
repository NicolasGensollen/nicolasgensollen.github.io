I am a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks](http://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team, at the computer science laboratory of Paris 6 (LIP6) since December 2018. My work at LIP6 is focused on designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions. This kind of data mixing structure and time is extremely common nowadays and spans several domains like sociology (social interactions between human being like phone calls, SMS, likes, comments, physical proximity...), finance (transactions and payments between accounts),
or networking (packet exchanges between machines, TCP sessions...) to name only a few. 

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Renewable Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA. I was mainly working on designing optimization methods to solve large scale problems related to the penetration of renewable energy sources in distribution systems. 

I did my PhD in Telecom SudParis, Saclay, France, where I was working on modeling smart grid systems.
