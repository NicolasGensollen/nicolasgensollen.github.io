I am a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks](http://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team, at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/) (LIP6) since December 2018. My work at LIP6 is focused on **designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions**. With the development of data collection devices and infrastructures, social interactions such as phone calls, messages, or physical proximities can be recorded. This kind of data, however, is not restricted to human interactions. In finance, for example, transactions between accounts can be represented as sequences of interactions. In networking, packet exchanges or TCP sessions between routers can also be studied using such framework. Although relatively simple at first glance, this kind of data have complex structural and temporal components and their proper modeling and analysis is challenging. Being able to not only model them, but automatically detect specific anomalous subsequences have **very promising applications such as fraud detection in finance, or network attack detection systems** for example.

I also have a strong interest in the study of **social systems relying on the blockchain technology**. These systems range from social networks where users can monetize their content to specific cryptocurrencies in which social ties are used to enhance security. In such environments, there exists complex interplays between pure social interactions and financial transactions. Understanding these interactions requires designing new models and is an active and fascinating field of research.

Before working at LIP6, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the *Power Systems Design and Studies* group at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA. The objective of this group is to study how power distribution systems can sustain the increasing penetration of renewable energy resources. Distribution systems have complex non linear dynamics and ensuring their stability with increasing penetration of renewables is a challenge. Within this group, I was mainly working on creating and implementing optimization methods to solve large scale problems such as distribution planning or hosting capacity analysis. Designing these *smart power grids* is a field of research at the crossroad of power system engineering, computer science, telecommunication, electronics, statistics, economy, sociology, and many more. I particularly enjoyed working in such an interdisciplinary field of research and building collaboration with researchers from different domains and with different backgrounds.

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on modeling and optimizing *smart power grid systems*. For more details, you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01454975/document).

In addition to my research work, I have a strong interest in open source projects. You can find some of my contributions in the *Open Source* section of this website.
