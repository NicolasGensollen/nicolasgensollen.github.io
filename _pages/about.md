I am a postdoctoral reasearcher in the [Complex Networks](http://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team, at the [computer science laboratory of Paris 6](https://www.lip6.fr/) (LIP6) since December 2018. My work at LIP6 is focused on designing methods for the automatic detection of anomalies in large sequences of interactions. This kind of data mixing structure and time is extremely common nowadays and spans several domains such as sociology (social interactions between human being like phone calls, SMS, likes, comments, physical proximity...), finance (transactions and payments between accounts), or networking (packet exchanges between machines, TCP sessions...) to name only a few. 

I also have a strong interest in the study of social systems relying on the blockchain technology. These systems range from social networks where users can monetize their content to specific cryptocurrencies in which social ties are used to enhance security. In such environments, there exists complex interplays between pure social interactions and financial transactions. Understanding these interactions requires designing new models and is an active and fascinating field of research.

Before working at LIP6, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Renewable Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, USA. I was mainly working on designing optimization methods to solve large scale problems related to the penetration of renewable energy sources in power distribution systems. These systems have complex non linear dynamics and ensuring their stability with increasing penetration of renewable energy sources is a challenge. Designing these *smart power grids* is a field of research at the crossroad of power system engineering, computer science, telecommunication, electronics, statistics, economy, sociology, and many more.

I obtained my PhD in October 2016, at [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), Saclay, France. My PhD work was focused on modeling and optimizing *smart power grid systems*. For more details, you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01454975/document).

In addition to my research work, I have a strong interest in open source projects. You can find some of my contributions in the *Open Source* section of this website.
